DevOps

DevOps is not just a set of tools or processesâ€”it is a culture that emphasizes cross-team 
collaboration, shared ownership, and continuous improvement throughout the software delivery process.
In a DevOps environment, teams work together to break down silos, improve communication, 
and take collective responsibility for building, deploying, and supporting software.

The goal of DevOps is to foster a culture of innovation while implementing technologies 
that automate and streamline critical aspects of the application lifecycle. 
It impacts not only engineers but also product managers, operations, and even business stakeholders, 
making it an organization-wide transformation.

A key principle of DevOps is resilience: 
the ability to detect issues quickly and recover rapidly through automation, monitoring, 
and continuous feedback. By prioritizing fast recovery and constant learning, 
DevOps enables organizations to deliver software that is more reliable, efficient, 
and aligned with user needs.
