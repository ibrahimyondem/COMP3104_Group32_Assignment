COMP3104 DevOps course is being taught in the 3rd year, 5th semester, of the T177 - Computer Programming and Analysis program at George Brown College.
Our section is taught by Profession Pritesh Patel, and our lectures and labs happen online, every Wednesday, between 18.00 and 21.00.

In this course, we explore best practices and learn to use the tools and technologies required to implement DevOps.
We learn the procedures, protocols, and best practices that a DevOps engineer brings to a workplace environment to increase productivity.

So far, the most useful skills that I learned in this course was setting up and using Node.js as runtime for my projects, and updating my GitHub repository with custom Actions.
