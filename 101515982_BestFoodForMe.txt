As I am from Turkey , for me Turkish cuisine is the best, Manti, Beyti, Adana, Lahmacun...
I love to cook and eat Turkish food. My family and friends are saying me that I am good cook.
However, I always eat and taste different foods from other cultures. 
My second favorite cuisines are definitely Mexican and Japanese. 
I love Fajitas and Japanese barbecue.
