Toronto has so many great places to visit, but a few stand out as my favorites.
I really enjoy going to the Toronto Islands, especially Centre Island, because it’s peaceful, close to nature, and offers an amazing view of the city skyline.
Another place I love is Distillery District, with its old-style brick buildings, cozy cafés, and unique art shops — it’s perfect for walking around and relaxing.
For something livelier, I often go to Yonge-Dundas Square or Nathan Phillips Square, where there’s always something happening, especially during festivals or holidays.
I also like visiting High Park, especially in the spring when the cherry blossoms bloom.
Lastly, Harbourfront and CN Tower are must-see spots that really represent Toronto’s beauty and modern side.
