This course is the one that supports teamwork the most among the courses I have taken so far.
The instructor clearly lays out the course requirements without being pushy, in an explanatory way. 
The assignments are designed not to overwhelm the student but to focus on teaching and encouraging division of tasks. 
This makes learning enjoyable.
