As I am from Turkey, for me football (soccer) is the best sport. 
I grew up watching and playing it with my friends almost every week. 
My favorite team is Galatasaray, and I always get excited when they play. 
I love the energy, teamwork, and passion that football brings.
 However, I also enjoy watching and trying different sports from other cultures. 
 My second favorite sports are definitely basketball and mixed martial arts. 
 I love the fast pace of basketball and the discipline and intensity of MMA.
