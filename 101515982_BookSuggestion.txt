Hello, 


Nowadays, I am reading "Eleanor Oliphant is completely Fine" by Gail Honeyman.
Having read most of it, I can confidently say that it's a very beautiful and moving book.
The necessity of finding a reason to live, no matter what, is beautifully explained. 
It's a book with a lot of psychological analysis. 
You'll definitely find something of yourself in it. 
I highly recommend it.
