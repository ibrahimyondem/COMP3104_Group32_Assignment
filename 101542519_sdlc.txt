Learning DevOps is important in the software development cycle because it bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery of software. By adopting practices like continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automated testing, teams can detect and fix issues early, reduce manual errors, and deliver updates more frequently. DevOps also emphasizes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility across teams, which improves efficiency and product quality. In todayâ€™s industry, where rapid iteration and scalability are critical, DevOps skills enable developers to streamline workflows, maintain stable systems, and respond quickly to user needs and market changes.
