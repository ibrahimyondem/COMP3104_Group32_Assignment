Hello,
My name is Baris. I am currently studying Software Engineering.
I was born and raised in Turkey, and I have been living in Canada for a while now.
I have previous work experience in the food industry, where I worked as a cook and later as a manager.
I really enjoy cooking, especially Turkish food, and I am also passionate about technology and coding.
In my free time, I like watching football, exploring new ideas, and spending time with my friends and family.
