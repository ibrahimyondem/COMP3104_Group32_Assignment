Learning DevOps is essential in the modern Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations. 
It enhances collaboration, speeds up delivery, and ensures consistent product quality through automation and continuous integration/deployment. 
By adopting DevOps practices, teams can respond to changes faster, reduce errors, and maintain stable production environments. 
Understanding DevOps allows software engineers to be more adaptable and effective in agile and fast-paced development environments.
